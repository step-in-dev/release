1. The precise limit on the number of available commands for the turtle is now displayed in the message for a task not completed. ![screenshot with example](2024-06-16/command-restriction.png)
2. Added the ability to view variable values for Python during step-by-step program execution. ![screenshot with example](2024-06-16/debugger-added.png)
3. Improved scaling of the turtle window. Now we do not try to fit the entire turtle field on the screen by adding scroll bars to the field. Instead, we allow the page content to extend beyond the screen edges. This is convenient when needing to enlarge the display while presenting on a projector.
4. Added a step-by-step execution button for Dave. ![screenshot with example](2024-06-16/dave-debugging.png)
5. Added tasks involving the use of the "for" loop for the turtle in Python.
